_Changes for v 7.0.4_:
- Fixed the alien_controller placement on the isolated floor;
- Glasses for the first and the second floor have been splitted in isolation mode;
- Balconies and the second floor are not placed a bit higher (`120pts` vs `112pts`);
- Fixed the lighting coefficient for the first floor in the isolation mode;
- Jumppads control changed from manual to auto;
- Updated the user guide;
- Implemented the ***complete floors separation***. Now you can generate maps with two almost isolated floors (both are accessible from each other);
- Maps writing algorithm has been rebuilt: it is possible now to add furniture elements that will replace floor or ceiling blocks (like windows or holes);
- Some dark textures have been replaced;
- Removed extraneous sequence from hgrunt model (to prevent it from staying under player's attack)
