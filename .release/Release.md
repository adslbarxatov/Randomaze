_Changes for v 5.2_:
- Turrets are now required to get the level achievement;
- Alien slaves now running faster;
- Fixed some minor runtime bugs;
- Core updates have been applied;
- App will not add headcrabs into crates when they are disabled in the enemies permissions tab. This will increase parts of explodable crates and crates with snarks (if corresponding options are enabled);
- Probably, fixed the gravity triggering (engine is now ineligible to skip it)
