_Changes for v 1.2_:
- Implemented the *walls density coefficient* (from 1 to 12). The larger the value, the fewer “branches” the maze will have. `12` means almost a snake-shaped corridor, `1` is for a hangar with a few walls;
- Diversity of weapons and enemies will now increase right from the first map;
- Light “bulbs” will now be added as part of world geometry (will not be counted as entities);
- Number overflow protection added (999 is the limit for the maps chain)
