_Changes for v 3.4_:
- Code for furniture processing has been refactored, some new objects have been added;
- App will now properly scroll the compilation log to its end;
- App will now save the compilation log to the file after exiting;
- Fixed some interface bugs;
- Improved the furniture alignment algorithm;
- Implemented the random sky boxes;
- Fixed lights placement in the dark mode;
- Implemented the ***map lighting coefficient***. It will affect the quantity of active lights inside the compartments and the type of the sky outside;
- Implemented the filter for the map section type. Now you can select only “under sky” or only “inside the room” maps;
- Added the restriction for size-walls coefficients pair: too large mazes with too small walls density are exceeding the compiler’s limitations;
- Empty crates can now rarely spawn some useful stuff that is not available in other sources
