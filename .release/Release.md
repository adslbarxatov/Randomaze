_Changes for v 6.1_:
- Implemented the crates balance instead of flags for crates with items and crates with explosives. Its edges (+3 and -3) allow you to disable corresponding types of crates (items or explosives);
- The crate density value can now be set to zero to disable crates altogether;
- Access and appearance of the Lab Policy have been updated;
- Implemented the ability to add the navigation mesh to the maps;
- Implemented the built-in map compiler based on Zoner's tools sources
