_Changes for v 2.0_:
- Implemented the settings window. It will be called on the first start of this version of the app or when `-s` key is specified;
- Settings file has been replaced with the system registry. At the first start settings from the file will be automatically converted;
- Added cockroaches (in addition to rats);
- Different crate “bugs” now have different crate textures; empty crates will have random textures
