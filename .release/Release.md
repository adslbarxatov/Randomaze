_Changes for v 3.1_:
- Code for map sections has been completely refactored;
- Removed redundant code;
- Fixed some interface bugs;
- App now has a manageable interface. It allows you to:
    - change settings right before the map compilation without extraneous shortcuts;
    - manually cleanup previous saves and compiled maps;
    - interrupt the compilation if necessary;
    - view error messages in a more convenient way.
- All keys except `-m` and `-go` have been removed. Some of them have been implemented as new interface elements;
- Added `-n` key that will enable generation of the extraneous maps. I. e. without this key map will not be generated if the required one already exists;
- Adjusted furniture types for some locations;
- Added visual doors for internal walls that have only one visible side;
- Difficulty coefficient divided by `enemies density` and `items density`
