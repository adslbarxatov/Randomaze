_Changes for v 4.7_:
- Maps now support achievements. If you eliminate all enemies (except for rats, roaches and tripmines) you will get full armor and health levels. Also there is an achievement for squashing all rats and roaches. But it is difficult to get. So, it does nothing for now;
- Some new textures have been applied;
- The video presentation has been updated;
- If turret enemy is enabled, app will randomly select the entity from turret, miniturret and sentry for its location;
- App now able to repeat the map generation if the previous try exceeded the maximum of engine entities quantity; app will also adjust the generation settings to prevent this situation on the next try;
- App will not start if one copy of it is already running. It allow us to prevent multiple calls on game reloadings;
- Implemented the ability to randomize the “two floors” and “allow items for balconies” flags
