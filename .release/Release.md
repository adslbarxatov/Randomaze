_Changes for v 4.3_:
- Fixed the tabstop order for the settings window;
- Implemented the gravity coefficient (100% is the default value; range from 10% to 200% is available; engine update is required);
- Added the ability to cleanup old maps (to save the space on your drive);
- Fixed bug with the crowbar skipping;
- Engine: fixed the long timeout for death of controller;
- Engine: probably, fixed the double reloading sound of the revolver;
- Implemented the ***items permission line***. It allows you to exclude some types of weapons from the random generation (both from floors and crates), as well as it works with types of enemies
