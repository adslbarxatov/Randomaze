_Changes for v 1.5_:
- Processing of the configuration file is now more strict;
- Implemented the R value for maze size, difficulty and walls density. This value will make the app randomly select these parameters for each generation;
- Breakable crates: snarks replaced with babycrabs (they are more durable);
- Added visual exit doors for maps
