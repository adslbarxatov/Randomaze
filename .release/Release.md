_Changes for v 4.7.7_:
- Updated the HypeHelp mechanics;
- Maps now support achievements. If you eliminate all enemies (except for rats, roaches and tripmines) you will get full armor and health levels. Also there is an achievement for squashing all rats and roaches. But it is difficult to get. So, it does nothing for now;
- Some new textures have been applied;
- The video presentation has been updated
