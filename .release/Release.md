_Changes for v 4.5_:
- Implemented the ability to randomize the “two floors” and “allow items for balconies” flags;
- Fixed the backward teleportation bug;
- Light bulbs have been “sunk” into the ceiling (for better experience with low gravity coefficients);
- The height of the second floor has been decreased; climbing on balconies is more comfortable now;
- Implemented the entities counter: it will allow us to avoid the MAX_ENTITIES errors;
- Adjusted SFX triggers placement;
- The SFX triggering has been rebuilt. Now it uses special form of trigger_sound that can detect its orientation and switch between two room types. It allowed us to make the triggering more accurate and decrease the quantity of map entities;
- The map number has been added as the chapter name for the map;
- Added quick scroll buttons for the console window
