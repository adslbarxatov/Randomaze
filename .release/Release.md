_Changes for v 2.1_:
- Implemented the algorithm for map furniture generation. It properly skips enemies and crates and properly attaches to walls (skips windows and open air). Furniture kinds autoselection will be implemented in the next version (now all types can be found both under ceiling and under sky);
- Steps replaced with special stones on the floor;
- Implemented the settings window. It will be called on the first start of this version of the app or when `-s` key is specified;
- Settings file has been replaced with the system registry. At the first start settings from the file will be automatically converted;
- Added cockroaches (in addition to rats);
- Different crate “bugs” now have different crate textures; empty crates will have random textures
