_Changes for v 4.8.3_:
- Fixed an achievements miscounting when map size auto-adjustment applies;
- Achievements counter now works with monster makers (only for “original” enemies);
- Fixed rats and cockroaches miscounting;
- ***Monstermakers*** have been implemented. When this option is enabled, some monsters will be replaced with monstermakers (using the same permission settings for their “children”). Each monstermaker can be triggered only once by the death of one of existing monsters. They can be triggered even by smashing rats and cockroaches (so, it can be unexpected some time). Every trigger event will be accompanied with the teleport sound;
- Loudness of ambient sounds has been rebalanced;
- Some other fixes have been applied
