_Changes for v 7.0_:
- Implemented the ***complete floors separation***. Now you can generate maps with two almost isolated floors (both are accessible from each other);
- Maps writing algorithm has been rebuilt: it is possible now to add furniture elements that will replace floor or ceiling blocks (like windows or holes);
- Fixed some old minor bugs;
- Some dark textures have been replaced;
- Removed extraneous sequence from hgrunt model (to prevent it from staying under player's attack);
- Neon lights are now available for maps with 75% lighting (indoors)
