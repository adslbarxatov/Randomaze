_Changes for v 5.1.6_:
- App will not add headcrabs into crates when they are disabled in the enemies permissions tab. This will increase parts of explodable crates and crates with snarks (if corresponding options are enabled);
- Probably, fixed the gravity triggering (engine is now ineligible to skip it);
- The offline help has been updated to new version;
- Completed the process of version control unification;
- Added the end-to-end commands for enemies and items permissions;
- Added the unavailable spaces filling algorithm to decrease the map compilation time;
- Fixed potential settings reset on calling end-to-end commands with bad values
