Randomaze changes log

ToDo:
- Improve the SFX triggering?

Version 4.3.5:
• Fixed some tips;
• Adjusted the objects generation algorithm;
• Adjusted the presentation of the current settings list in the console;
• App will now save the generation log (with settings and PRNG results) for every map

Version 4.3:
• Fixed the tabstop order for the settings window;
• Implemented the gravity coefficient (100% is the default value; range from 10% to 200%
  is available; engine update is required)

Version 4.2:

• Fixed bug with the crowbar skipping;
• Engine: fixed the long timeout for death of controller;
• Engine: probably, fixed the double reloading sound of the revolver

Version 4.1:
• Implemented the items permission line. It allows you to exclude some types
  of weapons from the random generation (both from floors and crates), as well as
  it works with types of enemies;
• Added an adjustment to the density of enemies on first maps: the coefficient
  will decrease when the average value is exceeded;
• Settings interface has been rebuilt

Version 4.0:
• ES:Randomaze is now a stand-alone mod;
• Added support for superabilities: player will get the opportunity to enable
  them every 10th map

Version 3.8.5:
• Added an axe;
• Added autosave triggers for map entry points and button places;
• Adjusted the startup method (according to the new engine requirements)

Version 3.8:
• XPR control has been implemented;

Version 3.7.8:
• Implemented the ability to open localized ADP, SCP and Welcome pages;
• Required framework version updated from 4.0 to 4.8

Version 3.7:
• Adjusted textures for some environment types;
• Added the ability to filter the crate types or disable them at all;
• Settings window has been redesigned;
• App now saves images of generated mazes;
• Improved the enemies generation algorithm: it will not replace all forbidden
  enemies with rats and roaches (only when no enemies available on the current
  PRNG round)

Version 3.6.5:
• Added the flag that allows you to permit the generation of collectable items at
  the second floor of maps (on balconies);
• Some code refactoring has been applied

Version 3.6:
• Added lamps for balconies (for two-level maps);
• Added ladders to provide the ability to climb on balconies (for two-level maps);
• Tested the correct placement for tripmines; they are also available now

Version 3.5:
• Adjusted furniture types for some exteriors;
• Sky type selector is now more flexible;
• Implemented the two-level map generation;
• Implemented the random “balcony” placement (for two-level maps);
• Shooting and jumping enemies can be placed on balconies (for two-level maps);
• Barnacles can now be enabled (for two-level maps);
• Added some new types of furniture;
• Some code refactoring has been applied

Version 3.4.1:
• Some interface bugs fixed;
• Added new engine assembly (rebuilt for the MSVC RTL 142 / 2015 – 2022)

Version 3.4:
• Code for furniture processing has been refactored, some new objects have been added;
• App will now properly scroll the compilation log to its end;
• App will now save the compilation log to the file after exiting;
• Fixed some interface bugs;
• Improved the furniture alignment algorithm;
• Implemented the random sky boxes;
• Fixed lights placement in the dark mode

Version 3.3.1:
• Some minor fixes applied

Version 3.3:
• Implemented the map lighting coefficient. It will affect the quantity of active lights
  inside the compartments and the type of the sky outside;
• Implemented the filter for the map section type. Now you can select only “under sky” or
  only “inside the room” maps;
• Added the restriction for size-walls coefficients pair: too large mazes with too small
  walls density are exceeding the compiler’s limitations;
• Some code refactoring has been applied;
• Empty crates can now rarely spawn some useful stuff that is not available in other
  sources;
• Settings saving now works properly;
• Loading settings from the configuration file is not available anymore;
• A path to the exit is now literally highlighted

Version 3.2:
• If user changes the compilation settings before running the mod, app will:
  - delete all maps following the one on which the player last saved;
  - immediately rebuild the next map after the saved one.
  So, changes will be applied faster, right after the next “jump”;
• Compilation mechanism has been properly encapsulated into its own thread: app interface
  will not freeze on this operation anymore;
• Removed some obsolete code;
• Command line keys -n and -go are not required anymore. But they are still available for
  possible further applications;
• Command line key -m replaced with -x (next). If the map name is specified, it will work
  as well as -m key, but also it will enable the functionality of -n and -go keys. So, -x
  key is now the only one that required to switch the app into the “continue playing” mode

Version 3.1:
• Code for map sections has been completely refactored;
• Some redundant code has been removed;
• Fixed some interface bugs

Version 3.0:
• App now has a manageable interface. It allows you to:
  - change settings right before the map compilation without extraneous shortcuts;
  - manually cleanup previous saves and compiled maps;
  - interrupt the compilation if necessary;
  - view error messages in a more convenient way.
• All keys except -m and -go have been removed. Some of them have been implemented as new
  interface elements;
• Added -n key that will enable generation of the extraneous maps. I. e. without this key map
  will not be generated if the required one already exists;
• Adjusted furniture types for some locations;
• Added visual doors for internal walls that have only one visible side;
• Difficulty coefficient divided by enemies density and items density

Version 2.2:
• Types of furniture are now correspond to types of exterior;
• Fixed possible attachment of furniture items to exit doors;
• Adjusted algorithm of furniture generation

Version 2.1:
• Implemented the algorithm for map furniture generation. It properly skips enemies and crates
  and properly attaches to walls (skips windows and open air). Furniture kinds autoselection will
  be implemented in the next version (now all types can be found both under ceiling and under sky);
• Steps replaced with special stones on the floor

Version 2.0:
• Implemented the settings window. It will be called on the first start of this version
  of the app or when -s key is specified;
• Settings file has been replaced with the system registry. At the first start settings
  from the file will be automatically converted;
• Added cockroaches (in addition to rats);
• Different crate “bugs” now have different crate textures; empty crates will have random
  textures

Version 1.7:
• Walls generation mechanism has been upgraded: they are flat now, and some of them
  now have correct borders;
• Added the crates density coefficient;
• Crates are now more dynamic;
• The hornetgun has been added

Version 1.6:
• Controllers and houndeyes have been added to the enemies list;
• Crate height has been doubled: now it can be hit by other enemies;
• Implemented the “button mode”. If enabled, among other things you will need to find
  the button that opens the exit gate

Version 1.5:
• Processing of the configuration file is now more strict;
• Implemented the R value for maze size, difficulty and walls density. This value will make
  the app randomly select these parameters for each generation;
• Breakable crates: snarks replaced with headcrabs (they are more durable);
• Added visual exit doors for maps

Version 1.4:
• Implemented the requirements check: app will not start the process if needed tools or WAD
  is missing;
• Added crates with explosives and alive snarks (may be helpful in some cases);
• Some fixes and improvements applied to maps geometry

Version 1.3:
• Complete code refactoring has been performed; the speed of map generation has been increased
  (thanks to the removal of extraneous conversion calls);
• Added glass windows on edges of map sections;
• Some file operations have been improved;
• Cleanup key will now work properly;
• Implemented the permissions line for enemies. It consists of key letters. If the enemy’s key
  letter is presented, he / it will be available on the map

Version 1.2:
• Implemented the walls density coefficient (from 1 to 12). The larger the value, the fewer
  “branches” the maze will have. 12 means almost a snake-shaped corridor, 1 is for a hangar
  with a few walls;
• Diversity of weapons and enemies will now increase right from the first map;
• Light “bulbs” will now be added as part of world geometry (will not be counted as entities);
• Number overflow protection added (999 is the limit for the maps chain)

Version 1.1:
• Algorithm of generation of the entry point and the end point has been rewritten (it will not cause
  remarkable effect, but it allows rectangle-shaped mazes);
• App now able to skip the game start (-go key) and cleanup save and maps directories (-c key);
• Source code has been refactored;
• Adjusted the appearance of the entrance portal;
• Maps can now be played continuously, one from another;
• Maps generator will now be called automatically by the engine at the start of the map; it will
  work in background mode during your walkthrough;
• File paths are now fully correct;
• App will now get the next map number directly from the maps directory;
• App can now get the size coefficient for the maze and the difficulty coefficient from the
  Randomaze.cfg file;
• App will skip generation, if the next map already exists

Version 1.0:
• The first release:
  - path builder;
  - walls / gates generator;
  - space filler;
  - visible geometry extractor;
  - map elements writer: walls, gates, lights, sounds, SFX, enemies, items, decals, sprites, triggers;
  - map compiler.
• Publication on GitHub (delayed).
