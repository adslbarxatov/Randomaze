Randomaze changes log

ToDo:
- Add 'allow' strings for enemies and items;
- Add extra geometry;
- Remove redundant code

Version 1.2:
• Implemented the walls density coefficient (from 1 to 12). The larger the value, the fewer
  “branches” the maze will have. 12 means almost a snake-shaped corridor, 1 is for a hangar
  with a few walls;
• Diversity of weapons and enemies will now increase right from the first map;
• Light “bulbs” will now be added as part of world geometry (will not be counted as entities);
• Number overflow protection added (999 is the limit for the maps chain)

Version 1.1:
• Algorithm of generation of the entry point and the end point has been rewritten (it will not cause
  remarkable effect, but it allows rectangle-shaped mazes);
• App now able to skip the game start (-go key) and cleanup save and maps directories (-c key);
• Source code has been refactored;
• Adjusted the appearance of the entrance portal;
• Maps can now be played continuously, one from another;
• Maps generator will now be called automatically by the engine at the start of the map; it will
  work in background mode during your walkthrough;
• File paths are now fully correct;
• App will now get the next map number directly from the maps directory;
• App can now get the size coefficient for the maze and the difficulty coefficient from the
  Randomaze.cfg file;
• App will skip generation, if the next map already exists

Version 1.0:
• The first release:
  - path builder;
  - walls / gates generator;
  - space filler;
  - visible geometry extractor;
  - map elements writer: walls, gates, lights, sounds, SFX, enemies, items, decals, sprites, triggers;
  - map compiler.
• Publication on GitHub (delayed).
