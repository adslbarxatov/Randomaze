Randomaze changes log

ToDo:
- Recompilation after settings changes;
- Remove extraneous command line keys;
- Split pre- and post-compilation operations

Version 3.1:
• Code for map sections has been completely refactored;
• Some redundant code has been removed;
• Fixed some interface bugs

Version 3.0:
• App now has a manageable interface. It allows you to:
  - change settings right before the map compilation without extraneous shortcuts;
  - manually cleanup previous saves and compiled maps;
  - interrupt the compilation if necessary;
  - view error messages in a more convenient way.
• All keys except -m and -go have been removed. Some of them have been implemented as new
  interface elements;
• Added -n key that will enable generation of the extraneous maps. I. e. without this key map
  will not be generated if the required one already exists;
• Adjusted furniture types for some locations;
• Added visual doors for internal walls that have only one visible side;
• Difficulty coefficient divided by enemies density and items density

Version 2.2:
• Types of furniture are now correspond to types of exterior;
• Fixed possible attachment of furniture items to exit doors;
• Adjusted algorithm of furniture generation

Version 2.1:
• Implemented the algorithm for map furniture generation. It properly skips enemies and crates
  and properly attaches to walls (skips windows and open air). Furniture kinds autoselection will
  be implemented in the next version (now all types can be found both under ceiling and under sky);
• Steps replaced with special stones on the floor

Version 2.0:
• Implemented the settings window. It will be called on the first start of this version
  of the app or when -s key is specified;
• Settings file has been replaced with the system registry. At the first start settings
  from the file will be automatically converted;
• Added cockroaches (in addition to rats);
• Different crate “bugs” now have different crate textures; empty crates will have random
  textures

Version 1.7:
• Walls generation mechanism has been upgraded: they are flat now, and some of them
  now have correct borders;
• Added the crates density coefficient;
• Crates are now more dynamic;
• The hornetgun has been added

Version 1.6:
• Controllers and houndeyes have been added to the enemies list;
• Crate height has been doubled: now it can be hit by other enemies;
• Implemented the “button mode”. If enabled, among other things you will need to find
  the button that opens the exit gate

Version 1.5:
• Processing of the configuration file is now more strict;
• Implemented the R value for maze size, difficulty and walls density. This value will make
  the app randomly select these parameters for each generation;
• Breakable crates: snarks replaced with headcrabs (they are more durable);
• Added visual exit doors for maps

Version 1.4:
• Implemented the requirements check: app will not start the process if needed tools or WAD
  is missing;
• Added crates with explosives and alive snarks (may be helpful in some cases);
• Some fixes and improvements applied to maps geometry

Version 1.3:
• Complete code refactoring has been performed; the speed of map generation has been increased
  (thanks to the removal of extraneous conversion calls);
• Added glass windows on edges of map sections;
• Some file operations have been improved;
• Cleanup key will now work properly;
• Implemented the permissions line for enemies. It consists of key letters. If the enemy’s key
  letter is presented, he / it will be available on the map

Version 1.2:
• Implemented the walls density coefficient (from 1 to 12). The larger the value, the fewer
  “branches” the maze will have. 12 means almost a snake-shaped corridor, 1 is for a hangar
  with a few walls;
• Diversity of weapons and enemies will now increase right from the first map;
• Light “bulbs” will now be added as part of world geometry (will not be counted as entities);
• Number overflow protection added (999 is the limit for the maps chain)

Version 1.1:
• Algorithm of generation of the entry point and the end point has been rewritten (it will not cause
  remarkable effect, but it allows rectangle-shaped mazes);
• App now able to skip the game start (-go key) and cleanup save and maps directories (-c key);
• Source code has been refactored;
• Adjusted the appearance of the entrance portal;
• Maps can now be played continuously, one from another;
• Maps generator will now be called automatically by the engine at the start of the map; it will
  work in background mode during your walkthrough;
• File paths are now fully correct;
• App will now get the next map number directly from the maps directory;
• App can now get the size coefficient for the maze and the difficulty coefficient from the
  Randomaze.cfg file;
• App will skip generation, if the next map already exists

Version 1.0:
• The first release:
  - path builder;
  - walls / gates generator;
  - space filler;
  - visible geometry extractor;
  - map elements writer: walls, gates, lights, sounds, SFX, enemies, items, decals, sprites, triggers;
  - map compiler.
• Publication on GitHub (delayed).
